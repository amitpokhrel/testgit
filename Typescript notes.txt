Typescript:
is a language build on top of jS with the purpose of avoiding the pitfalls of js. does this by adding Type. Typescript is superset of Javascript.

Type (in typescript): Static checking -> detect errors in code without running. does this pre-runtime. helps to find errors, only in development phase later compiled to JS.

Install:
npm install -g typescript
and we have access to tsc -v
Typescript playground: where you can use typescript without installing ts in local
Compile Ts to JS: tsc <.ts filename>

Syntax: let myVar: type = value
